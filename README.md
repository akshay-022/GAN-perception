# GAN-perception
This was part of the project we did for the course CS726-Advanced ML taken by Prof. Sunita Sarawagi at IIT Bombay.

We trained a GAN on images of nature and sceneries with labels about the type of scenery (forests, glaciers, etc).
We also trained a CNN on these same labelled images using ResNet to classify any scenery into its type.

We then implemented the Clip Glass algrithm, and gave the input prompt as beautiful. We then analyzed the scenery types the GAN considered most beautiful and its correlation with percentages of scenery types in our dataset.
